    <h1>ClarityRead — Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 9, 2025</p>
    <p>These Terms govern your use of the ClarityRead Chrome extension, companion website, and related services ("ClarityRead", "we", "us"). By installing or using ClarityRead you accept these Terms. If you do not agree, please uninstall the extension and discontinue use.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>ClarityRead is provided to help improve reading accessibility and focus online. You may use ClarityRead for personal, educational, and accessibility-related purposes.</p>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for unlawful, harmful, or abusive purposes;</li>
      <li>Attempt to copy, modify, reverse-engineer, or redistribute the Service (or parts of it) without written permission;</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt normal operation of the Service or other users' access.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Privacy and Data</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important. ClarityRead's data handling practices are described in the <a href="https://tonna16.github.io/clarityread-site/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ClarityRead does not collect personally-identifying information without your consent.</li>
      <li>Extension settings and preferences are stored locally in your browser unless you opt into remote sync features.</li>
      <li>If you connect a Google account, OAuth is used to access Google Docs for reading features — tokens are handled per Google's OAuth rules. I request only the minimum scopes required for reading documents.</li>
      <li>I do not sell or trade user data.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>ClarityRead may interact with third-party services (for example, Google Docs or Microsoft Office). Those services are subject to their own terms and privacy policies. You are responsible for complying with any third-party terms that apply to your use.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>ClarityRead, its code, designs, logos, and documentation are the property of the developer. You may not reproduce or redistribute the Service without prior written permission.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided <strong>"as is"</strong> and <strong>"as available"</strong>. I make no warranties that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, compatible with every site or document viewer, or that it will meet your expectations. Use the Service at your own risk.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developer (and any affiliates) will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of data or profits arising out of or related to your use of the Service.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Accounts, Registration, and Google OAuth</h2>
    <p>Some features (such as reading Google Docs) require optional Google account authorization using OAuth. When you authorize ClarityRead to access your Google data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I request only the scopes necessary for the feature (for example, <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly</code> for Google Docs reading).</li>
      <li>If Google displays warnings like "app not verified" during testing, that is related to Google's verification process — please contact me if you encounter access issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>I may update these Terms occasionally. Significant changes will be posted on the website. Continued use after updates means you accept the new Terms.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the developer's jurisdiction, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.</p>
  </section>
