  <h1>Privacy Policy — ClarityRead</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <strong>2025-10-23</strong></p>

  <h2>Who we are</h2>
  <p>ClarityRead is created and maintained by an independent developer. This extension is offered to help make reading on the web easier via dyslexia-friendly fonts, reflowed reading, read-aloud, and a local summarizer.</p>

  <h2>Summary — no remote data transfer by default</h2>
  <p><strong>ClarityRead does not send page content or user selections to any remote server by default.</strong> The summarizer and text-to-speech use local browser capabilities. All user data described below is stored locally in the browser unless you explicitly enable an optional cloud feature (which will prompt you and request your consent).</p>

  <h2>What we store locally</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Preferences</strong> (font choice, reflow, high contrast, voice settings) — stored in <code>chrome.storage.local</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Saved reads / summaries</strong> — stored locally and accessible only to the extension in your browser profile.</li>
    <li><strong>Reading statistics</strong> — aggregated locally for charts and usage insights.</li>
    <li><strong>Export / Import</strong> — you may export saved reads & settings as a JSON file and re-import them at your discretion. Exported files are under your control.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What we do NOT collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect or store browsing history, page URLs, or page content on our servers by default.</li>
    <li>We do not collect personal data or identifiable information unless you explicitly provide it (for example, in a support email).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Optional cloud features (explicit opt-in only)</h2>
  <p>If an optional remote/cloud feature exists or is added later (for example, server-side summarization or backup), it will be clearly marked in the UI and will only be used after obtaining your explicit consent. If you enable such a feature, the extension will tell you exactly what data will be sent and to which host. You can revoke the feature at any time from extension settings.</p>

  <h2>Text-to-speech</h2>
  <p>ClarityRead uses your browser's built-in speech synthesis (the Web Speech API) — voices available are provided by your browser/OS. No audio or text is sent to external services for TTS unless you explicitly enable an optional cloud TTS feature (which will prompt you first).</p>

  <h2>Security & retention</h2>
  <p>Data stored locally remains on your device and will remain until you delete it or uninstall the extension. If you enable any optional cloud feature, that remote data retention will be described in the opt-in dialog. We encourage you not to upload extremely sensitive personal information to any service.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy or want to request deletion of any server-side data you opted into, contact: <a href="mailto:you@example.com">ttonnaagburu@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy occasionally. The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect changes.</p>
